# Mori Autonomous Development Loop

This document is the operating guide for Ralph-style autonomous
development of Mori. It is a **living document** — sections 7 and 8
(the backlog and the next slice) are kept current as the project
evolves. Sections 1–6 and 9 are stable policy.

Read [`docs/mori-project-goal.md`](mori-project-goal.md) first; it is
the canonical product direction, implementation-status guide, and
non-goal list. This document governs *how* the loop runs.

## 1. Operating Goal

Keep building Mori into a real local-first AI work memory product.

The product loop is:

```
Claude / Codex / ChatGPT / CLI / Git / terminal work
→ explicit capture/import
→ Preview
→ Import Review
→ Timeline / Evidence Hub
→ Project Memory
→ Consolidation Review
→ Accepted Memory
→ Resume Prompt / Reports
→ continue work
```

## 2. Ralph Behavior

Ralph should:
- inspect current repo state
- choose the next highest-value production slice
- implement it
- test it
- update relevant docs
- update this autonomous loop document if the backlog changes
- commit exactly one clean commit
- continue to the next slice automatically

Ralph should not stop just because:
- one milestone is complete
- a milestone is substantial
- a fresh session would be nicer
- a small product decision is needed
- a living goal document update is needed

If a capability is large, Ralph should split it into the smallest
useful production slice and start.

## 3. Decision Standard

Ralph may make product decisions when they are governed by:
- docs/mori-project-goal.md
- existing architecture
- local-first principles
- review-before-apply principles
- evidence-first principles
- long-term extensibility

Choose the option that is:
- product-coherent
- extensible
- testable
- honest about current capability
- safe for user data
- compatible with SQLite, .mori packages, desktop workflows, and
  future connectors

Do not choose temporary shortcuts just because they are easier.

## 4. Hard Non-Goals

Never implement:
- account scraping
- Claude Desktop database scraping
- ChatGPT browser scraping
- Cursor internal database scraping
- browser history scraping
- screen recording
- keylogging
- hidden clipboard capture
- hidden background monitoring
- cloud sync by default
- OAuth integrations
- external account reading
- always-on daemon
- scheduled consolidation jobs
- automatic memory writes without review
- Workroom / Session Canvas / pixel-agent UI unless explicitly
  reprioritized
- Google ADK / Gemini dependency
- embeddings/vector search as source of truth
- broad unrelated rewrites

## 5. Validation Contract

Before every commit:

```
npm run check:full
npm run build
git diff --check
git status --short
```

If src-tauri changed:

```
cd src-tauri
cargo check
cargo test
cd ..
```

## 6. Commit Rules

One clean commit per production slice.

Do not include:
- Co-Authored-By
- Generated with Claude
- AI footers
- validation logs
- audit logs
- “already in place”
- “no changes”

Do not push unless explicitly asked.

## 7. Current Autonomous Backlog

Maintain this list as the project evolves. Capability-based names
only — no phase numbers.

**Completed (do not redo):**
- Queryable Memory — accepted-memory search helper
  (`searchAcceptedMemories`).
- Queryable Memory — Project Memory search UI (`QueryableMemoryCard`).
- Queryable Memory — extension to timeline events, evidence sources,
  and review-action notes (`searchProjectMemoryReferences`).
- Local Connector Capture polish — real `mori-local-capture` output
  verified to round-trip; clean-repo git snapshot coverage added.
- `.mori` native file-open affordance — file picker on the
  Consolidation Review import panel (browser `File` API, no Tauri).
- `.mori` auditTrail package slice — optional additive
  `auditTrail?: StoredMemoryReviewAction[]` on `MoriPackageV0`,
  populated on export with `getPackageAuditTrail` read helper.

**Open priority (highest first):**

1. Memory Audit Trail reviewed revert flow
2. SQLite / `.mori` parity cleanup (e.g. SQLite-side `importSummary`
   mirror)
3. CLI wrapper for Claude/Codex workflows, explicit/local only
4. IDE / Terminal integration planning, no hidden monitoring

Deferred — revisit when a concrete need appears:
- Evidence / Import Review polish — audited; the Import Review view,
  the `review` lib, and the connector pipeline are mature and
  well-tested with no concrete defect. Revisit when real captured
  data exposes a specific honesty / correctness gap.

When an item ships, move it to **Completed** and renumber the open
list. When the goal document's Current Gaps change, reconcile this
backlog with it.

## 8. Current Next Slice

The next slice should be:

**Memory Audit Trail reviewed revert flow — revert eligibility helper**

Goal:
A pure helper that decides whether a Memory Audit Trail action can be
reverted and describes the restore it would perform — without
applying anything. This is the foundation of the reviewed revert
flow; the actual review/apply path is a later slice.

Scope — do:
- Add `src/lib/project-memory/memoryReviewRevert.ts` with a pure
  `planMemoryReviewRevert(action, acceptedMemories)` returning a
  `MemoryReviewRevertPlan` — eligibility, a reason when ineligible,
  and the target memory id + status to restore from the action's
  `before` snapshot.
- Eligible only when the action carries a usable `before` snapshot
  with a `status`, the target memory still exists, and the action
  type is status-changing (`accept` / `edit` / `apply` / `watch` /
  `defer` / `reset`).
- Read only the `status` string from the snapshot — never raw
  evidence, titles, or summaries.
- No IO, no mutation, no apply — revert is itself review-before-apply.

Scope — do not:
- Apply the revert or write any memory in this slice.
- Auto-revert imported `.mori` audit rows — they are history.
- Surface `before` / `after` raw content beyond the `status` string.

Suggested files:
- `src/lib/project-memory/memoryReviewRevert.ts`
- `src/lib/project-memory/memoryReviewRevert.test.ts`
- `docs/project-memory-consolidation.md`

Tests:
- an eligible plan is produced from a valid `before` snapshot
- ineligible when the action has no `before` snapshot
- ineligible when the target memory no longer exists
- ineligible for an unsupported action type (e.g. `discard`)

After this slice ships, set the next slice to the apply path of the
reviewed revert flow, then continue with the open backlog.

## 9. Stop Conditions

Stop only if:
- working tree is dirty in a way Ralph cannot understand
- validation fails twice after attempted fixes
- the next task requires cloud sync, scraping, watchers, credentials,
  or account access
- the next task requires Workroom / Session Canvas / pixel-agent UI
- the next task requires a new dependency with product/security
  implications
- the next task requires destructive or ambiguous migration
- the next task cannot be split into a small production slice
- Ralph is about to push

Do not stop because a clean boundary was reached.
Clean boundary means commit and continue.

# Mori Autonomous Development Loop

This document is the operating guide for Ralph-style autonomous
development of Mori. It is a **living document** — sections 7 and 8
(the backlog and the next slice) are kept current as the project
evolves. Sections 1–6 and 9 are stable policy.

Read [`docs/mori-project-goal.md`](mori-project-goal.md) first; it is
the canonical product direction, implementation-status guide, and
non-goal list. This document governs *how* the loop runs.

## 1. Operating Goal

Keep building Mori into a real local-first AI work memory product.

The product loop is:

```
Claude / Codex / ChatGPT / CLI / Git / terminal work
→ explicit capture/import
→ Preview
→ Import Review
→ Timeline / Evidence Hub
→ Project Memory
→ Consolidation Review
→ Accepted Memory
→ Resume Prompt / Reports
→ continue work
```

## 2. Ralph Behavior

Ralph should:
- inspect current repo state
- choose the next highest-value production slice
- implement it
- test it
- update relevant docs
- update this autonomous loop document if the backlog changes
- commit exactly one clean commit
- continue to the next slice automatically

Ralph should not stop just because:
- one milestone is complete
- a milestone is substantial
- a fresh session would be nicer
- a small product decision is needed
- a living goal document update is needed

If a capability is large, Ralph should split it into the smallest
useful production slice and start.

## 3. Decision Standard

Ralph may make product decisions when they are governed by:
- docs/mori-project-goal.md
- existing architecture
- local-first principles
- review-before-apply principles
- evidence-first principles
- long-term extensibility

Choose the option that is:
- product-coherent
- extensible
- testable
- honest about current capability
- safe for user data
- compatible with SQLite, .mori packages, desktop workflows, and
  future connectors

Do not choose temporary shortcuts just because they are easier.

## 4. Hard Non-Goals

Never implement:
- account scraping
- Claude Desktop database scraping
- ChatGPT browser scraping
- Cursor internal database scraping
- browser history scraping
- screen recording
- keylogging
- hidden clipboard capture
- hidden background monitoring
- cloud sync by default
- OAuth integrations
- external account reading
- always-on daemon
- scheduled consolidation jobs
- automatic memory writes without review
- Workroom / Session Canvas / pixel-agent UI unless explicitly
  reprioritized
- Google ADK / Gemini dependency
- embeddings/vector search as source of truth
- broad unrelated rewrites

## 5. Validation Contract

Before every commit:

```
npm run check:full
npm run build
git diff --check
git status --short
```

If src-tauri changed:

```
cd src-tauri
cargo check
cargo test
cd ..
```

## 6. Commit Rules

One clean commit per production slice.

Do not include:
- Co-Authored-By
- Generated with Claude
- AI footers
- validation logs
- audit logs
- “already in place”
- “no changes”

Do not push unless explicitly asked.

## 7. Current Autonomous Backlog

Maintain this list as the project evolves. Capability-based names
only — no phase numbers.

**Completed (do not redo):**
- Queryable Memory — accepted-memory search helper
  (`searchAcceptedMemories`).
- Queryable Memory — Project Memory search UI (`QueryableMemoryCard`).
- Queryable Memory — extension to timeline events, evidence sources,
  and review-action notes (`searchProjectMemoryReferences`).
- Local Connector Capture polish — real `mori-local-capture` output
  verified to round-trip; clean-repo git snapshot coverage added.
- `.mori` native file-open affordance — file picker on the
  Consolidation Review import panel (browser `File` API, no Tauri).
- `.mori` auditTrail package slice — optional additive
  `auditTrail?: StoredMemoryReviewAction[]` on `MoriPackageV0`,
  populated on export with `getPackageAuditTrail` read helper.
- Memory Audit Trail reviewed revert flow — eligibility planner,
  proposal builder, apply helper, per-entry view-model eligibility,
  and the confirm-gated Revert affordance in the audit card.
- SQLite / `.mori` parity cleanup — schema-completeness check now
  covers the V003 accepted-memory tables (`consolidated_memories` /
  `consolidated_memory_audit`) in `requiredSqliteTables`.
- CLI wrapper for Claude/Codex workflows — `mori-local-capture.py
  --transcript -` reads a piped CLI session from stdin (explicit,
  local-only, no subprocess wrapping or background watching).
- IDE / Terminal integration planning — explicit-capture design doc
  in `source-integrations.md` (explicit emit, no background watch).
- SQLite `importSummary` mirror — complete: V004 `session_imports`
  migration, `sessionImportRows` converters, the Rust repository, the
  `persist` / `list` / `list_all` Tauri commands, the runtime-aware
  `SessionImportRepository`, and `loadConnectorImportHistorySavedSessionsAsync`
  wired into the `ImportPanel` connector preview so desktop sessions
  feed the re-import rollup.
- Native file picker for `.mori v0` — `save_mori_package_json_as`
  (Save As) and `pick_mori_package_file` (Open) native dialogs, wired
  into the Reports export and the Consolidation Review import panel.
- Local Connector Capture bridge — `mori-local-capture.py` covers
  transcript (file + stdin), note, git working-tree, and `--git-commit`
  inputs, all verified through the connector-pipeline fixture test.
- `.mori` zip-like file layout — `buildMoriPackageFileLayout` turns a
  `MoriPackageV0` into the documented one-file-per-slice map
  (dependency-free; the zip archiving step is a separate decision).
- `.mori v0` import validation hardening — `validateMoriPackage` now
  checks each slice's per-record identity fields with precise paths.
- `.mori` zip-like layout round-trip — `parseMoriPackageFileLayout`
  reassembles a validated `MoriPackageV0` from the one-file-per-slice
  map, the inverse of `buildMoriPackageFileLayout` (dependency-free).
- Connector template fixture coverage — the `claude-code` and
  `codex-cli` connector sample JSONL are guarded by pipeline
  round-trip tests, mirroring the local-capture fixture test.
- IDE integration — first artifact: `connectors/vscode-task/`, a VS
  Code task template that runs `mori-local-capture.py` on an explicit
  Run Task action (no extension, no watcher).

**Open priority (highest first):**

1. Terminal integration — first artifact: a shell-function template
   (`connectors/terminal-helper/`) wrapping `mori-local-capture.py`
   for quick explicit terminal capture, the terminal counterpart of
   the VS Code task template.

Then the dependency-free, in-scope backlog is converged: the items
below are **deferred** pending an explicit product / dependency /
scope decision. The loop should not invent a slice to avoid this —
surface the decision instead (see section 9 stop conditions).

Deferred — revisit when a concrete need appears:
- Evidence / Import Review polish — audited; the Import Review view,
  the `review` lib, and the connector pipeline are mature and
  well-tested with no concrete defect. Revisit when real captured
  data exposes a specific honesty / correctness gap.
- Optional watched-inbox tray — borders on the no-background-watcher
  non-goal; the refresh-only desktop inbox already covers the safe
  case. Revisit only with a concrete, explicitly-triggered design.
- IDE / Terminal integration runtime code — the explicit-capture
  design is documented; building an editor extension waits for a
  concrete first integration target.
- `.mori` zip archiving step — the file-layout builder + parser are
  shipped (`buildMoriPackageFileLayout` / `parseMoriPackageFileLayout`);
  the actual zip archive needs an archiving dependency, which is a
  product/security decision the loop must not make unilaterally.
  Revisit when the dependency is explicitly approved.
- Team / shared memory beyond the `.mori v0` package round trip — a
  large surface with no concrete near-term requirement.

When an item ships, move it to **Completed** and renumber the open
list. When the goal document's Current Gaps change, reconcile this
backlog with it.

## 8. Current Next Slice

The next slice should be:

**Terminal integration — `mori-capture` shell-function template**

Goal:
The VS Code task template is shipped; this is its terminal
counterpart. A shell-function template gives a terminal user a short
explicit command to capture work into Mori, reusing the local-capture
bridge — no watcher, no shell-history scraping.

Scope — do:
- Add `connectors/terminal-helper/` with a `mori-capture.sh` defining
  a shell function (bash / zsh) the user sources from their rc file.
  The function wraps `mori-local-capture.py` — e.g.
  `mori-capture git` → `--git-repo .`, `mori-capture commit` →
  `--git-commit HEAD`, `mori-capture note "<text>"` → `--note`.
- Add a `README.md`: setup, the explicit-capture / non-goal
  boundaries (no history scraping, no watcher), and the event mapping
  table.
- Update `docs/source-integrations.md` — the Terminal History entry
  and the IDE / Terminal plan section reference the shipped template.

Scope — do not:
- Read `~/.bash_history`, scrollback, or any command the user did not
  explicitly pass to `mori-capture`.
- Add an alias that runs on every prompt or any background hook.

Suggested files:
- `connectors/terminal-helper/mori-capture.sh` (new)
- `connectors/terminal-helper/README.md` (new)
- `docs/source-integrations.md`

Tests:
- none — template + docs; validation is `check:full` + `build`
  staying green (the capture outputs are already fixture-tested).

After this slice ships, both the IDE and terminal explicit-capture
first artifacts exist. The remaining backlog (`.mori` zip archive,
team memory, an actual editor extension) is deferred pending an
explicit dependency / scope / proven-in-use decision — surface that
to the user per section 9 rather than inventing a slice.

## 9. Stop Conditions

Stop only if:
- working tree is dirty in a way Ralph cannot understand
- validation fails twice after attempted fixes
- the next task requires cloud sync, scraping, watchers, credentials,
  or account access
- the next task requires Workroom / Session Canvas / pixel-agent UI
- the next task requires a new dependency with product/security
  implications
- the next task requires destructive or ambiguous migration
- the next task cannot be split into a small production slice
- Ralph is about to push

Do not stop because a clean boundary was reached.
Clean boundary means commit and continue.
